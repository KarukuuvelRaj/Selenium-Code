a) Create a class by name: Firefox (with main method) 
b) Create following variables inside the main method
    1) version = 100.2  (float)
    2) name = "firefox" (String)
    3) visible = true (boolean)
    4) year = 1998 (int)
    5) logo = 'm' (char)
c) print all data types statement
d) run and confirm the printed in console


a) Create a class by name: Chrome (with no main method) in same package
b) Create a method by name: getName()
c) Print a statement inside the method --> "This is google chrome"
d) Call the method getName() from class: Browser using object reference
e) Run Browser class and Confirm the printed in console


Classroom Assignment 4: Find Factorial of a given number
Goal: To understand the for loop and logic writing
a) Create a class by name: Factorial
b) Create a main method using shortcut
c) Declare a class variable of type of int with a value as input
d) Write a logic to print the factorial of the given input
Hint: use for loop from 1 --> n and multiply with previous multiplied value


Classroom Assignment 5: Print if the given number is odd or even
Goal: To understand the mod operator, conditional statement and logic writing
a) Create a class by name: OddOrEven
b) Create a main method using shortcut
c) Declare a class variable of type of int with a value as input
d) Write a logic to print if the given input is odd or even
Hint: Divide the given input by 2 and if the remainder is 0 -> even else odd. 
Use mod (%) operator to find remainder

Assignments:
1. Print Fibonacci Series for first 11 numbers
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
Goal: To understand Arithmetic Operation and Loop
a) Create class called Fibonacci
b) Create main method using shortcut
c) write a logic to print fibonacci from 0 to 56
Hints:
Initialize 3 int variables (Tip: firstNum = 0; secNum = 1, sum=0)
Print first Number
Iterate from 1 to 11
Add first and second number and assign to sum
Assign second number to first number
Assign sum to second number
Print sum
Time to given: 15 - 20 mins

2) Print if given number is Prime
Goal: To understand problem solving, looping and conditional statement
a) Create class called Prime
b) Create main method using shortcut
c) write a logic to check if Prime
d) Prime if it is Prime or not
Hint:
Iterate all numbers from 0 to (n-1) input and 
for every number check  if it divides n (input)
If we find any number that divides, print prime
If nothing divides, print not prime
Time to give
